## Implementation Approach

All features were implemented surgically to ensure:
1. No existing functionality was broken
2. The lightweight, no-server architecture was preserved
3. All enhancements work seamlessly together
4. The user experience was enhanced without complexity
5. Performance was maintained or improved

## Testing

All JavaScript files have been validated for syntax correctness. A test file (`test-features.html`) is available to verify functionality.

To use the enhanced features:

3. See smart tag suggestions when adding tags
4. View enhanced relationship visualization in the graph panel
5. Check recommendations when opening notes
6. Use the "Filters" button for advanced search
7. Access note history through the "History" button in the editor
